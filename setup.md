Singularity has become popular and usually it is available in the institutional computing resources. 
Check if Singularity is available with 
```bash
singularity --version
```

If your local computing system does not have Singularity installed, you may 
[request it to your system administrator](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/user-guide/quick_start.html#installation-request).  

Preparation of containers with superuser permissions require Singularity in resources with 
access as root. See the [quick installation steps](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps)
if you would like to install Singularity in your computer.
