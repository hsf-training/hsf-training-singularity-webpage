As shown in the previous chapter, building containers with an interactive session may take several steps, and it can
become as complicated as the setup is needed.
A Singularity definition file provides an easy way to build and deploy containers.


## Hello World Singularity

The following recipe shows how to build a hello-world container, and run the container on your local computer.

- Step 1: Open a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, or gedit in a graphical environment)

  ```bash
  nano hello-world.def
  ```

- Step 2: Include the following script in the `hello-world.def` file to define the environment

  ```bash
  BootStrap: docker
  From: ubuntu:20.04

  %runscript
    echo "Hello World"
  # Print Hello world when the image is loaded
  ```

    In the above script, the first line - `BootStrap: docker` indicates that singularity will use docker to create the base OS to start the image. The `From: ubuntu:20.04` is given to singularity to start from a specific image/OS.  Any content within the  `%runscript` will be written to file that is executed when one runs the singularity image. The `echo "Hello World"` command will print the `Hello World` on the terminal. Finally the `#` hash is used to include comments within the definition file.

- Step 3: Build the image

  ```bash
  singularity build helloworld.sif hello-world.def
  ```

    The `helloworld.sif` file specifies the name of the output file that is built when using the `singularity build` command.

- Step 4: Run the image

  ```bash
  ./helloworld.sif
  ```

### Deleting Singularity image

To delete the helloworld Singularity image, use the following command:

```bash
singularity delete helloworld.sif
```


## Example of a more elaborated definition file

Let's look at the structure of the definition file with another example. Let's prepare a container from an [official
Ubuntu image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu), but this time we will install ROOT with RooFit and Python integration.


Following the ROOT instructions to
[download a pre-compiled binary distribution](https://root.cern/install/#download-a-pre-compiled-binary-distribution),
the definition file will look like

~~~
BootStrap: docker
From: ubuntu:20.04

%post
    apt-get update -y
    apt-get install wget -y
    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
    apt-get install dpkg-dev cmake g++ gcc binutils libx11-dev libxpm-dev \
    libxft-dev libxext-dev python libssl-dev libgsl0-dev libtiff-dev -y
    cd /opt
    wget https://root.cern/download/root_v6.22.06.Linux-ubuntu20-x86_64-gcc9.3.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf root_v6.22.06.Linux-ubuntu20-x86_64-gcc9.3.tar.gz

%environment
    export PATH=/opt/root/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/root/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PYTHONPATH=/opt/root/lib

%runscript
    python /opt/root/tutorials/roofit/rf101_basics.py

%labels
    Author HEPTraining
~~~
{: .source}

Let's take a look at the definition file:
* The first two lines define the base image. In this case, the image `ubuntu:20.04` from Docker Hub is used.
* `%post` are lines to execute inside the container after the OS has been set. In this example, we are listing the
steps that we would follow to install ROOT with a precompiled binary in an interactive session.
Notice that the binary used corresponds with the Ubuntu version defined at the second line.
* `%environment` is used to define environment variables available inside the container. Here we are setting the env
variables required to execute ROOT and PyROOT.
* Singularity containers can be executable. `%runscript` define the actions to take when the container is executed.
To illustrate the functionality, we will just run [rf101_basics.py](https://root.cern/doc/master/rf101__basics_8py.html)
from the RooFit tutorial.
* `%labels` add custom metadata to the container.

Save this definition file as `myUbuntu.def`. To build the container, just provide the definition file as argument
(executing as superuser):
~~~bash
sudo singularity build rootInUbuntu.sif myUbuntu.def
~~~
{: .source}

Then, an interactive shell inside the container can be initialized with `singularity shell`, or
execute a command with `singularity exec`. A third option is execute the actions defined inside `%runscript`
simply by calling the container as an executable

~~~bash
./rootInUbuntu.sif
~~~
{: .source}

You will find the output file `rf101_basics.png` in the location where the container was executed.

> ## Deploying your containers
> Keep in mind that, while build a container requires superuser permissions, the execution can be performed anywhere.
> Once your container is built with the requirements of your analysis, you can deploy it in a large cluster and execute it
> as far as Singularity is available on the site.
>
> Be smart, and this will open endless possibilities in your workflow.

Here we have covered the basics with a few examples focused to HEP software.
Check the (Singularity docs)[https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/user-guide/build_a_container.html] to see all the available
options and more details related to the container creation.
