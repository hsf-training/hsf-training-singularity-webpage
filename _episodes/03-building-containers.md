Running containers from the available public images is not the only option. In many cases, it is required to modify
an image or even to create a new one from scratch. For such purposes, Singularity provides the command `build`,
defined in the documentation as the _Swiss army knife_ of container creation.

While images contained in the `.sif` files are immutable objects, ideal for reproducibility, for building images is
more convenient the usage of a _sandbox_.

Building images requires access to a machine with Singularity and superuser permissions. The usual workflow is prepare
a container in a build environment (like your laptop), either with an interactive session or from a definition file,
and then deploy the container into a production environment for execution (as your institutional cluster).

# Build a container in a interactive session

For building a container from a existing image in an interactive way, `build` provides a flag `--sandbox` that will
create a writable directory.

~~~bash
$ singularity build --sandbox myCentOS7 docker://centos:centos7
~~~
{: .source}

The sandbox name is `myCentOS7`, and it has been initialized from the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos)
of CentOS7.
To initialize an interactive session use `shell`. And to write files within the sandbox directory  `--writable`.
Additionally, the installation of new components will require superuser access:

~~~bash
$ sudo singularity shell --writable myCentOS7

Singularity> whoami
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
root
~~~
{: .output}

As an example, let's create a container with Pythia8 available using the `myCentOS7` sandbox.
First, we need to install the development tools (remember that in this interactive session we are superuser):

~~~bash
Singularity> yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
Singularity> yum install python3-devel
~~~
{: .source}

We will follow the
installation steps described in the [Pythia website](http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html).
In short, we just need to execute:

~~~bash
Singularity> mkdir /opt/pythia && cd /opt/pythia
Singularity> curl -o pythia8303.tgz http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia8/pythia8303.tgz
Singularity> tar xvfz pythia8303.tgz
~~~
{: .source}

To enable the Python interface, we add the flag `--with-python-include` during the configuration, pointing to the
location of the Python headers:

~~~bash
Singularity> ./configure --with-python-include=/usr/include/python3.6m/
Singularity> make

Singularity> exit
~~~
{: .source}

Now, open an interactive session with your user (no `sudo`). You can use now the container with Pythia8 ready in a
few steps. Let's use the Python interface:

~~~bash
singularity shell myCentOS7

Singularity> export PYTHONPATH=/opt/pythia/pythia8303/lib:$PYTHONPATH
Singularity> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/pythia/pythia8303/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Singularity> python3

>>> import pythia8
>>> pythia = pythia8.Pythia()

Notice that we need to define the environment variables `PYTHONPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in order to use Pythia on Python.
We will automate this in the next section.
