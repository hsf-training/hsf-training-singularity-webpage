title: "Containers and Images"
teaching: 20
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How to pull Singularity images from the libraries?"
- "How to run commands inside the containers?"
objectives:
- "Learn to search and pull images from the Singularity library and Docker Hub."
- "Interact with the containers using the command-line interface."
keypoints:
- "A container can be started from a local `.sif` or directly with the URL of the image."
- "Singularity is also compatible with Docker images, providing access to the large collection of images hosted by Docker Hub."
- Get a shell inside of your container with `singularity shell <path/URL to image>`
- Execute a command inside of your container with `singularity exec <path/URL> <command>`
- Bind outside directories with `--bind`

# The Singularity Command Line Interface

Singularity provides a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the containers. You can search, build or run
containers in a single line.

You can check the version of the Apptainer or Singularity command you are using with the `--version` option:
```bash
singularity --version
# This works for both Singularity and Apptainer, which installs a link named `singularity` to maintain compatibility.
# In the future you may need to use `apptainer --version`
```
For this training we recommend Apptainer >= 1.0 or Singularity >= 3.5. Older versions may not have some of the features or behave differently.
If you need to install or upgrade Apptainer/Singularity please refer to the [Setup section]({{ page.root }}{% link setup.md}).
When asking for support please remember to include the version of Apptainer or Singularity being used, as in the output of the above commands.

You can check the available options and subcommands using `--help`:

```bash
singularity --help
```

# Downloading Images

Apptainer/Singularity can store, search and retrieve images in registries.
Images built by other users can be accessible using the CLI, can be pulled down, and become containers at runtime.

Sylabs, the developers of one Singularity flavor, hosts a public image registry, the
[Singularity Container Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library) where many user built images are available.

The Linux Foundation flavor, Apptainer, does not point by default to the Sylab registry as previous versions did.
You can change that running these commands (documented [here](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/endpoint.html#restoring-pre-apptainer-library-behavior)):
```bash
singularity remote add --no-login SylabsCloud cloud.sycloud.io
```
~~~
INFO:    Remote "SylabsCloud" added.
~~~
{: .output}
```bash
singularity remote use SylabsCloud
```
~~~
INFO:    Remote "SylabsCloud" now in use.
~~~
{: .output}
```bash
singularity remote list
```

SylabsCloud    cloud.sycloud.io     YES     NO      NO
...
~~~
{: .output}

Once you have setup a working registry you can use search and pull.
The command `search` lists containers of interest
and shows information about groups and collections. For example:

```bash
# this command can take around a minute to complete
singularity search centos7
```

~~~
No users found for 'centos7'

Found 1 collections for 'centos7'
        library://shahzebmsiddiqui/easybuild-centos7

Found 15 containers for 'centos7'
        library://gmk/default/centos7-devel
                Tags: latest
...
~~~
{: .output}

Downloading an image from the Container Library is pretty straightforward:
```bash
singularity pull library://gmk/default/centos7-devel
```
and the image is stored locally as a `.sif` file (`centos7-devel_latest.sif`, in this case).

> ## Docker Images
>
> Fortunately, Singularity is also compatible with Docker images. There are many more registries with Docker images.
> [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is one of the largest libraries available,
> and any image hosted on the hub can be easily downloaded with the `docker://` URL as reference:
> ```bash
> singularity pull docker://centos:centos7
> ```
{: .callout}

# Running Containers

There are several ways to interact with images and start containers. Here we will review how to initialize a shell
environment and how to execute directly a command.

## Initializing a shell and exiting it

The `shell` command initializes a new interactive shell inside the container.

```bash
singularity shell centos7-devel_latest.sif
```

~~~
Singularity>
~~~
{: .output}
In this case, the container works as a lightweight virtual machine in which you can execute commands.
Remember, inside the container you have the same user and permissions.

```bash
Singularity> id
```

~~~
uid=1001(myuser) gid=1001(myuser) groups=1001(myuser),500(myothergroup)
~~~
{: .output}

Now quit the container by typing

```bash
Singularity> exit
```

or hitting `Ctrl + D`.
Note that when exiting from the singularity image all the running processes are killed (stopped).
Changes saved into bound directories are preserved. By default anything else in the container is lost (we'll see later about writable images).

## Bound directories

When an outside directory is accessible also inside Singularity we say it is *bound*, or bind mounted. The path to access it
may differ but anything you do to its content outside is visible inside and vice-versa.
By default, Singularity binds the home of the user, `/tmp` and `$PWD` into the container. This means your files
at `hostname:~/` are accessible inside the container. You can specify additional bind mounts using the `--bind` option.
For example, let's say `/cvmfs` is available in the host, and you would like to have access to CVMFS inside the
container (here, *host* refers to the computer/server that you are running singularity on). Then let's do

```bash
singularity shell --bind /cvmfs:/mnt centos7-devel_latest.sif
```

Here, the colon `:` separates the path to the directory on the host (`/cvmfs/`) from the mounting point (`/mnt/`) inside of the
container.
If you do not have CVMFS, you can try the command with [`/opt`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12649407/), for example.
More information on binding is provided [later]({{ site.baseurl }}/07-file-sharing).

Let's check that this works:

~~~
Singularity> ls /mnt/cms.cern.ch
bin                        etc                  SITECONF           slc7_aarch64_gcc530
bootstrap.sh               external             slc5_amd64_gcc434  slc7_aarch64_gcc700
...

> ## URLs as input
> Each of the different commands to set a container from a local `.sif` also accepts the URL of the image
> as input. For example, starting a shell with Scientific Linux 6 is as easy as
> ```bash
> singularity shell docker://sl:6
> ```

## Executing commands

The command `exec` starts the container from a specified image and executes a command inside it.
Let's use the official [Docker image of ROOT](https://hub.docker.com/r/rootproject/root) to start ROOT
inside a container:

```bash
singularity exec docker://rootproject/root root -b
```

And just like that, ROOT can be used in any laptop, large-scale cluster or grid system
with Singularity available.
