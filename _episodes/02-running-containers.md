title: "Containers and Images"
teaching: 20
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How to pull Singularity images from the libraries?"
- "How to run commands inside the containers?"
objectives:
- "Learn to search and pull images from the Singularity library and Docker Hub."
- "Interact with the containers using the command-line interface."
keypoints:
- "Singularity images are accessible from the CLI, and they become containers during the execution."
- "A container can be  from a local `.sif` or directly with the URL of the image."
- "Singularity is also compatible with Docker images, providing access to the large collection of images hosted by Docker Hub."

# The Singularity Command Line Interface

Singularity provides a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the containers. You can search, build or run
containers in a single line.

You can check the available options and subcommands using `--help`:

~~~bash
$ singularity --help
~~~
{: .source}

# Downloading Images

The [Singularity Container Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library) is the official image registry.
Images built by users are accessible using the CLI, and images become containers at runtime.

The command `search` provides containers of interest
and information about groups and collections. For example:
~~~bash
$ singularity search centos7
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
No users found for 'centos7'

Found 1 collections for 'centos7'
        library://shahzebmsiddiqui/easybuild-centos7

Found 15 containers for 'centos7'
        library://gmk/default/centos7-devel
                Tags: latest
...
~~~
{: .output}

Downloading an image from the Container Library is pretty straightforward:
~~~bash
$ singularity pull library://gmk/default/centos7-devel
~~~
{: .source}
and the image is stored locally as a `.sif` file (`centos7-devel_latest.sif`, in this case).

> ## Docker Images
>
> Fortunately, Singularity is also compatible with Docker images. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
> is one of the largest libraries available, and any image hosted on the hub can be easily downloaded
> with the `docker://` URL as reference:
> ~~~bash
> $ singularity pull docker://centos:centos7
> ~~~
{: .callout}

# Running Containers

There are several ways to interact with images and start containers. Here we will review how to initialize a shell
environment and how to execute directly a command.

## Initializing a shell

The `shell` command initializes a new interactive shell inside the container.
~~~bash
$ singularity shell centos7-devel_latest.sif
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
Singularity>
~~~
{: .output}
In this case, the container works as a lightweight virtual machine in which you can execute commands.
Remember, inside the container you have the same user and permissions.
~~~
Singularity> id
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
uid=1001(myuser) gid=1001(myuser) groups=1001(myuser),500(myothergroup)
~~~
{: .output}

By default, Singularity bind the home of the user, `/tmp` and `$PWD` into the container. It means your files
at `hostname:~/` are accessible inside the container. You can specify additional bind mounts using the `--bind` option.
For example, let's say `/cvmfs` is available in the host, and you would like to have access to CVMFS inside the
container. Then let's do

~~~bash
$ singularity shell --bind /cvmfs:/cvmfs centos7-devel_latest.sif
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
Singularity> ls /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
bin                        etc                  SITECONF           slc7_aarch64_gcc530
bootstrap.sh               external             slc5_amd64_gcc434  slc7_aarch64_gcc700
...
~~~
{: .output}

> ## URLs as input
> Each of the different commands to set a container from a local `.sif` also accepts the URL of the image
> as input. For example, starting a shell with Scientific Linux 6 is as easy as
> ~~~bash
> $ singularity shell docker://sl:6
> ~~~

## Executing commands

The command `exec` starts the container from an specified image and executes a command inside it.
Let's use the official [Docker image of ROOT](https://hub.docker.com/r/rootproject/root) to start ROOT
inside a container:

~~~bash
$ singularity exec docker://rootproject/root root -b
~~~
{: .source}
~~~

And just like that, ROOT can be used in any laptop, large-scale cluster or grid system
with Singularity available.
