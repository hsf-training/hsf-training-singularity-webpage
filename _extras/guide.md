The main course includes only the first 8 episodes
The bonus episode 9 "Building and deploying an Apptainer container to Github Packages"
is optional, also to avoid circular dependencies with Git and CI/CD.

Some more advanced material is interspersed throughout the episodes.
This helps understanding how containers and Apptainer work,
but are not strictly necessary for the basic use of Apptainer.
Future releases my separate this out in highlighted sections
to allow both a peruse of the course for a deeper understanding
and a quick run through to learn just the bare minimum.
